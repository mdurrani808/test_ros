## 0. Overview
This repository holds a **CAN driver software development kit** (SDK) for the [**MyActuator RMD X actuator series**](https://www.myactuator.com/rmd-x) written in modern C++17 using [Linux's SocketCAN](https://docs.kernel.org/networking/can.html). The driver SDK is also exposed to Python through Python bindings generated with [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).



## 1. Installation

This driver SDK requires the **following dependencies** to be installed. For Debian Linux they can be installed through `apt` as follows:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake
$ sudo apt-get install -y can-utils iproute2 linux-modules-extra-$(uname -r)
```

In case you want to use the Python bindings you will have to additionally install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/):

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-pybind11
```

After having installed its dependencies you will have to install the driver SDK either as a C++ library or Python package as described in the following steps. Both will use CMake to compile the C++ code.



### 1.1 Building the C++ library

For **building the C++ driver SDK** open a new terminal inside this folder and execute the following commands

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -D PYTHON_BINDINGS=on
$ make -j $(nproc)
```

The flag `PYTHON_BINDINGS` (defaults to `off`) builds the Python bindings additionally to the C++ library. In case you are only interested in using the C++ library feel free to leave it off. When building the Python bindings like this they will be compiled to a shared library but not be installed. This means you will either have to install the library manually or you will only be able to import them locally inside the `build` folder. 

### 1.2 Installing Python package

For **building and installing the Python bindings** for this SDK open a new terminal inside the main folder and execute the following command:

```bash
$ pip3 install .
```

This will use the `setup.py` to invoke CMake and install the bindings as a C++ library. If you want to remove them again simply invoke `$ pip3 uninstall myactuator-rmd-py`.

### 1.3 Building with ROS 2

For **building and installingthis package with ROS 2** open a new terminal on then top-level folder of your Colcon workspace (e.g. `colcon_ws`) and execute the following command:

```bash
$ colcon build --cmake-args -D PYTHON_BINDINGS=on -D BUILD_TESTING=on
```

where the two flags following `--cmake-args` are optional.



## 2. Using the Python bindings

**Load the library** and continue to create a driver for a particular network interface (here `can0`) and drive (here `1` corresponding to the CAN-address `0x140 + 1 = 0x141`) and control it through the Python API as shown below:

```bash
$ python3
Python 3.10.6 (main, Mar 10 2023, 10:55:28) [GCC 11.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from myactuator_rmd_py import Driver
>>> driver = Driver("can0", 1)
>>> driver.getVersionDate()
2023020601
>>> driver.sendPositionAbsoluteSetpoint(180.0, 500.0)
>>> driver.shutdownMotor()
```

In case you installed the package through ROS 2 the package name will be `myactuator_rmd` instead of `myactuator_rmd_py`.

For more information you might also inspect the contents of the module inside Python 3 with `help(myactuator_rmd_py)`.



## 3. Automated tests

For testing you will have to install the following additional dependencies

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y libboost-all-dev libgmock-dev libgtest-dev
```

The tests can then be build by passing the **additional flag `-D BUILD_TESTING=on`** to CMake. After building the driver SDK with the additional flag you will have to bring the virtual CAN interface up with:

```bash
$ sudo modprobe vcan
$ sudo ip link add dev vcan_test type vcan
$ sudo ip link set up vcan_test
```

Additionally there is a CMake flag `SETUP_TEST_IFNAME` that - if set to `on` - automatically sets up the virtual CAN interface for you but this requires the following command to be run as `sudo`.

Finally you can **launch all the tests** with the following command:

```bash
$ ctest
```
